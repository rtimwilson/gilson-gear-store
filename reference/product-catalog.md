# Gil-Son Merch Store — Product Catalog & Pricing Reference

This catalog is based on market research (see merch-store-research.md for full methodology). All prices CAD. Products are organized by fulfillment channel — Printful POD items can go live immediately with no inventory; premium/specialty items require supplier relationships and MOQs.

---

## Fulfillment Channel Guide

**Channel A — Printful POD (no inventory, API-integrated)**
These products are fulfilled automatically via the Printful API after Stripe payment. They are the store's core and should be built first.

**Channel B — Premium Suppliers (MOQ required, manual or drop-ship)**
These require supplier accounts with TPS Promotions, Carhartt Company Gear, GiftAFeeling, or specialty vendors. They can be listed in the store with "Request Quote" or "Pre-Order" flows, or managed through a separate bulk ordering process. Build these into Phase 4+ once the Printful backbone works.

## Products to NEVER Stock (Drawer-Dweller Hall of Shame)

These items have been specifically identified as failures in corporate merch research:

- Cheap polyester polo shirts
- Stress balls and squeeze toys
- Cheap plastic keychains
- Single-use chapstick
- Sleeping eye masks
- USB flash drives (obsolete)
- Generic power banks (fail quickly)
- Cheap earbuds
- Low-quality non-woven tote bags
- Stiff/boxy promotional tees (Tultex, cheap Gildan)
- Printful phone cases (inconsistent fit)
- Printful all-over prints (seam issues)

**The test**: Would you personally use this item regularly? If no, don't stock it. 60% of promo swag ends up in trash. Be the 40% people keep.

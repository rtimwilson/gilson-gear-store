## Logo Files Needed

Place the following Gil-Son logo files in this directory:

1. **gilson-logo.svg** — Full colour logo (for nav bar on dark backgrounds, used with white text)
2. **gilson-logo-white.svg** — All-white version (for use on red gradient backgrounds/overlays)
3. **gilson-logo-dark.svg** — Dark version (for use on light/white backgrounds if needed)
4. **gilson-favicon.ico** — 32x32 favicon (or provide a 512x512 PNG and Claude Code can generate the favicon)
5. **gilson-og.png** — 1200x630 Open Graph image for social sharing (optional — Claude Code can generate a placeholder)

### File Format Notes
- SVG is preferred for logos — scales to any size, tiny file, crisp at all resolutions
- If you only have PNG logos, provide them at the highest resolution available (ideally 1000px+ wide)
- The nav bar logo will display at approximately 160px wide on desktop, 120px on mobile
- The footer logo will display at approximately 200px wide

### Where These Get Used
- `gilson-logo.svg` → Nav bar (left-aligned, on navy gradient background)
- `gilson-logo-white.svg` → Hero sections with red/navy gradient overlays, footer
- `gilson-favicon.ico` → Browser tab icon
- `gilson-og.png` → When someone shares a link to the store on social media

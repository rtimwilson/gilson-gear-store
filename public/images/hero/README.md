## Hero & Banner Images

Place hero section background images here. These are used for:
- Home page hero banner (full-width, will have a colour overlay gradient on top)
- Category header banners
- Promotional banners

### Recommended Images
- Construction site wide shots (industrial feel)
- Halifax harbour/waterfront (local identity)
- Gil-Son vehicles/equipment fleet (brand credibility)
- Abstract industrial textures (concrete, metal, steel) for subtle backgrounds

### Technical Requirements
- Minimum 1920px wide for hero images (they span full viewport)
- JPG format preferred for photos (smaller file size)
- PNG for any images with transparency
- Aim for under 500KB per image (compress with TinyPNG or similar)

If you don't have hero images yet, Claude Code will use colour gradients and texture overlays as placeholders — they'll look good on their own.

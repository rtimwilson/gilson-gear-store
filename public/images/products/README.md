## Product Images

Product images come from two sources:

1. **Printful API** — Mockup images generated automatically when you design products in Printful's dashboard. These are pulled via API and cached. No manual work needed.

2. **Lifestyle/hero photos** — If you have any real photos of Gil-Son employees wearing merch, at job sites, at hockey games, etc., drop them here. These make the store feel authentic vs. purely mockup-driven.

### Recommended Lifestyle Photos (Optional)
- Team photo wearing Gil-Son gear
- Job site shots (hard hats, hi-vis, branded workwear)
- Hockey game / community event photos
- Halifax waterfront or local scenery for hero backgrounds

Any photos you add here will be available at `/images/products/filename.jpg` in the app.
